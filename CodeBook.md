This codebook contains the information of the variables found in the data used for the experiment.


Identifiers

	subject - Number to identify the subject that performed the experiment. From 1 to 30.
    activity - The type of activity measured and performed by the subject. 
	
Activities: 

    WALKING: Subject was walking during the test
    WALKING_UPSTAIRS: Subject was walking up a staircase during the test
    WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS: Subject was walking down a staircase during the test
    SITTING: Subject was sitting during the test
    STANDING: Subject was standing during the test
    LAYING: Subject was laying down during the test

Variables: These are the variables found in the file "mean_std_data.txt". This data contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
